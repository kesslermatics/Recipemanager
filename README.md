# Recipemanager

This is a simple but yet useful app to manage recipes and shoppinglists.

### Frontpage

At the frontpage you see your current shoppinglist. On the button "Hinzuf√ºgen" you can add recipes to your list. 
You can also edit and delete your list at any time so don't worry if you now don't remember all of your groceries to buy.
You can also use the button "Rezept importieren" to import all ingredients of a selected recipe. You can then edit this list.

### Recipelist

Here you see the recipelist. Currently there are only 2 recipes in there from standard.
By clicking on them you see the full description.

### Future

I haven't planned to expand features yet. Maybe to add recipes but that is not safe yet.
